Religion Changes

Problem:
Camping at an altar allows players to accumulate not only lots of death drops
but also ridiculously high maximum hit points and boatloads of divine
protection.
Crowning has few benefits to compensate for the increased prayer timeout.
The artifact granted can be obtained through sacrifice (or just dipping a
longsword into a fountain if you're Lawful) and the intrinsics can be obtained
from corpses.

Solution:

Make altar scumming more difficult.
Make crowning more difficult but more desirable.

(See also 001-alignment-overhaul)
Have monsters avoid standing on altars. They will still attack players who
stand on altars, so altars don't become a sort of permanent Elbereth.
Limit the amount of protection that can be given as a favor.
Have favors take away a few points of luck (but not reduce it below zero). As
a result, you might need to make more sacrifices than needed to nullify the
prayer timeout to get crowned.
Have spawning generate more difficult monsters based on how many sacrifices
the player makes.
Move the golden glow to a higher lookup number.
(Maybe) sacrificing too much angers your god.
Altars don't generate above B5.
Implement one or more of the following:
* Give more useful crowning artifacts. These will not be given through
  sacrifices, and they are unwishable.
  * Chaotic: a gray-and-silver DSM that provides only 4 AC but both MR and
    reflection?
* Modify the max HP given by the golden glow. I suggest 4 HP without crowning
  and 4 ~ 16 HP (avg 10) with crowning.
* If the lookup number for the favor is at least 8 but you are already
  crowned, select a random favor from the following list:
  * identify an item
  * give a random item as if the player aborted a wish; this does not break
  wishless conduct
  * very rarely, grant a wish (perhaps limit it to one as well)
* If you are crowned, the timeout limit to pray for trouble is increased.
