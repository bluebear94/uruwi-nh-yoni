Magic Portal Changes

Problem:
Accidentally attacking your quest leader or failing the AR test 7 times makes
the game unwinnable. This, however, is only a minor problem.

Solution:

When ejected from the quest, the magic portal does not disappear but rather
becomes inactivated for ~50,000 turns. The quest leader will still be angry
once you return.
Killing your quest leader opens the stairs to the quest, as in certain
variants.
To compensate, quest leaders will have better stats.
