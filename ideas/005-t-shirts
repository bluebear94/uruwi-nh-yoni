T-Shirts

Problem:
It would be nice to have a greater variety of T-shirts.

Solution:

T-shirts now appear in multiple colors (ideally displaying the tile with the
respective color), and these colors are shown in the description. They can
also have an image on them in place of text, or be blank; reading blank
T-shirts or those with images does not break illiterate conduct. The
probability of getting a certain type of pattern depends on the color, as
shown below:

Color | Blank |  Text | Image
White |  10 % |  50 % |  40 %
Other |  50 % |  20 % |  30 %

Certain messages on the T-shirt are associated with a certain color, and will
force the T-shirt to be that color. [Implementation detail: Declare all
custom-colored messages at the beginning of the array of messages, and check
if index is less than number of custom-colored messages.]

* I explored the Dungeons of Doom and all I got was this lousy T-shirt! ~
  white (since it's the only original T-shirt message)
* Anhur State University - Home of the Fighting Fire Ants! ~ red
* White Zombie ~ white
* Hey, black dragon!  Disintegrate THIS! ~ black
* Lichen Park ~ light green

Cancelling a T-shirt will make it blank.
