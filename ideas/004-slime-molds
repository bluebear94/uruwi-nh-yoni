Slime Molds

Problem:
It is impossible to set separate names for the slime mold item and the name
used to refer to slime mold farms.

Solution:

Allow setting these names in options separately. For example, you can have the
slime mold be called "a slice of watermelon" but get references to the
"watermelon farm" instead of the current "slice of watermelon farm". Also
allow defining a separate plural form so you can have "2 slices of watermelon"
rather than "2 slice of watermelons".

Also add a new mob called the "walking <fruit name>", a tiny mob of difficulty
2 and a speed slightly slower than the player's normal speed. It is
represented by a yellow F and drops 1 - 3 slime molds.

What about wishing for slime molds, though? Treat the singular form defined
in options as the singular form, the plural form (if defined separately) as
the plural, and the mass form as the singular as well. The default "slime
mold" is also allowed.
