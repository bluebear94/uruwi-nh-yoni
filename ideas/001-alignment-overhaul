Alignment Overhaul

Problem(s):
It is too easy to get a high alignment record; in fact, it is quite difficult
to have less than 20 AR. As a corollary, any loss of AR is inconsequential
to mid- to late-game players.

Solution:

Cap AR to +/- 30.
Make killing enemies give AR much more slowly (at 1/50 of the current rate?)
or not at all.
For fun: converting your own alignment flips the sign of your AR.
